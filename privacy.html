      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect personal information you provide—such as name, email, address, government-issued ID, and payment details—when creating your account or completing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. We also gather transactional data, trading history, wallet addresses, and device/browser usage. Technical metadata like IP addresses, geolocation, and cookies are captured to optimize service delivery.</p>
      <p>In addition, aggregated, anonymized usage data may be collected for analytics, system improvements, and behavioral modelling to enhance our AI trading platform. This data does not personally identify any user.</p>

    <section id="2">
      <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>We use your information to operate and improve our services—verifying identity, processing transactions, detecting fraud, ensuring compliance, providing customer support, and delivering AI-powered trading insights. Your data is also used for personalized user experience, security monitoring, and internal auditing.</p>
      <p>With your consent, we may send promotional communications via email or push notifications. You may opt out of these at any time.</p>

      <h2>3. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
      <p>AurumCapital uses essential, functional, analytical, and advertising cookies to provide and improve our services. These help maintain sessions, store preferences, and understand platform usage. Third‑party analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) may be used to improve performance and detect issues.</p>
      <p>You can manage or disable most cookies through your browser settings, but note this may impact your user experience.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We implement industry-leading security—TLS 1.3, AES‑256 encryption, multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure key storage, and regular vulnerability audits. Server infrastructure undergoes quarterly security assessments and penetration tests.</p>
      <p>While we take robust measures, no online service is completely risk-free. In case of a security breach that might impact your data, we will notify affected users and regulators within 72 hours under applicable U.S. laws.</p>
